	--------------------
	When a request is made to a page that was pre-rendered at build time, it will initially show the cached page.

	Any requests to the page after the initial request and before 10 seconds are also cached and instantaneous.
	After the 10-second window, the next request will still show the cached (stale) page
	Next.js triggers a regeneration of the page in the background.
	Once the page generates successfully, Next.js will invalidate the cache and show the updated page. If the background regeneration fails, the old page would still be unaltered.-

App vs Document
	https://ihatetomatoes-nextjs-101.vercel.app/post/app-and-document
	
	App
		_app.js is a special component that is used to initialize every page. 
		This is a place where you would do anything that needs to affect all pages, eg. load a global stylesheet.
		
	Document
		_document.js forms the overall structure of the HTML. If you need need to modify the html or body tags, _document.js is the place to do this.

		If you are chasing the perfect Lighthouse score, you will need to add the lang attribute to the html tag.

		We will also change the page background color here. Set the className for body to bg-gray-100.
