	Running with Capacitor
	a. Develop the Ionic app and sync it to the native project.
		>>> With each meaningful change, Ionic apps must be built into web assets before the change can appear on Android simulators and devices. 
			The web assets then must be copied into the native project. Luckily, this process is made easy with a single Ionic CLI command.
		ionic capacitor copy android
	b. In Android Studio, click the Run button and then select the target simulator or device.
	
	Live reload
	To start a live-reload server run the following command.
		ionic capacitor run android -l --host=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
