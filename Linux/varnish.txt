What is the purpose of the X-Varnish HTTP header? The X-Varnish HTTP header allows you to find the correct log-entries for the transaction. 
For a cache hit, X-Varnish will contain both the ID of the current request and the ID of the request that populated the cache. It makes debugging Varnish a lot easier.

The age is in seconds. If it is 0 then it means it is not cached. 
Also X-Varnish: if it is cached and working then there should be 2 sets of numbers. 
One is the request and the other is the response.

-----------------------------------
The x-cache header is were we store the information, using two terms that cover slightly different aspect of the content,

The first word can be:

hit: we are delivering an object from the cache
miss: the object comes from the backend after failing to find it in the cache.
pass: the object comes from the backend because the request bypassed the cache.
synth: we created a synthetic object on-the-fly to satisfy the request.
The second word will be:

cached: the object will be reused.
uncacheable: the object comes from the backend but will not be reused.
synth: synthetic object.
