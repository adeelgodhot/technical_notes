Error
	2021-11-17 19:23:01 : Wrong URL/path used for attribute image For SKU : "2120" in rows in rows: 20
	it means the image url returns error.
	
Tip
	when importing imags with url, please don't turn on the following setttings;
		Deferred Import Images
		Use Image Import Source
		
	when importing 
		product_type is required, like simple
		qty is required
		price is required
		
		
Link child to configurable product
	1. Feed
		include group in child row (will be used as parent sku)
	2. Profile
		Custom logic for creation of configurable products 
			On => Yes
		Create Configurable Products => Off (if parent already exists)
		Product attributes for variations
			=> color, size, length
=====================
Migration 1 to m2
	Import Settings:
		Platform: magento 1
	To import multiple images, try duplicate row of parent: but put only the fields of sku and images, and leave the rests with blank.
		NOTE: in that case, store shouldn't be set, that will cause the critical issue.
		
	the exported file from m1 contain "category_ids" with category ids
		That should contain the list of category names instead of category ids
		Or
		etc/platforms.xml
			<attribute code="category_ids" reference="categories" />
			==>
			<attribute code="category_ids" reference="category_ids" />
			
			but this work around will not import category becuase the system field for category is only "categories".
